        <h1>About Snow Day Predictor</h1>

        <p>Snow Day Predictor helps you estimate the likelihood of school closures and delays due to winter weather, with geography-aware calculations that account for regional snow tolerance.</p>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>Our advanced algorithm analyzes weather forecasts and calculates both <strong>closure</strong> and <strong>delay</strong> probabilities based on multiple factors:</p>

        <h4>Weather Conditions Analyzed:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Below-freezing conditions increase accumulation likelihood and dangerous road conditions</li>
            <li><strong>Snowfall Amount:</strong> Expected accumulation in inches (when available from NWS forecasts)</li>
            <li><strong>Precipitation Type:</strong> Snow, sleet, freezing rain, and wintry mix predictions</li>
            <li><strong>Precipitation Probability:</strong> Higher chances mean more reliable forecasts</li>
            <li><strong>Overnight Conditions:</strong> Snow or ice the night before significantly impacts morning commute safety</li>
            <li><strong>Forecast Severity:</strong> Keywords like "heavy snow," "blizzard," or "freezing rain" boost probabilities</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Geography-Aware Intelligence:</h4>
        <p>The algorithm adjusts predictions based on your location's snow tolerance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Southern States</strong> (FL, GA, SC, AL, MS, LA, TX, AR): Very low snow tolerance - even 1-2 inches can trigger closures. Schools may remain closed for 2-3 days after a winter event.</li>
            <li><strong>Mid-South</strong> (NC, TN, KY, VA, WV): Low to moderate tolerance - closures likely with 3+ inches. May see 1-2 day closures for significant events.</li>
            <li><strong>Mid-Atlantic/Lower Midwest</strong> (MD, DE, NJ, PA, OH, IN, MO): Moderate tolerance - 4-6 inches typically needed for closures.</li>
            <li><strong>Northeast/Upper Midwest</strong> (NY, New England, MI, WI, IL, MN): High tolerance - schools operate in moderate snow, closures mainly for 8+ inches or blizzard conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Mountain/Northern States</strong> (MT, WY, CO, ID, ND, SD, AK): Very high tolerance - closures rare except for extreme conditions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Closure vs. Delay:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Closures:</strong> Full school cancellations, typically for significant accumulation, dangerous temperatures, or when road conditions are unsafe</li>
            <li><strong>Delays:</strong> 1-2 hour delays for marginal conditions, light accumulation, or when road crews need extra time to clear routes. Often used when overnight weather improves by morning.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Multi-Day Impact:</h4>
        <p>In regions with low snow tolerance, a major winter event can cause closures for multiple consecutive days as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Roads remain uncleared or dangerous</li>
            <li>Refreezing occurs overnight</li>
            <li>Limited snow removal equipment availability</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Sources</h3>
        <p>Weather data is provided by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>National Weather Service (NOAA):</strong> Official forecast data and winter weather advisories</li>
            <li><strong>Zippopotam.us:</strong> ZIP code to city/state lookup</li>
            <li><strong>OpenStreetMap Nominatim:</strong> Geocoding and reverse geocoding services</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Accuracy & Limitations</h3>
        <p>While our algorithm considers many factors, please note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Predictions are based on weather <strong>forecasts</strong>, which can change</li>
            <li>Local road conditions, staffing, and district policies vary significantly</li>
            <li>Rural vs. urban areas within the same district may have different impacts</li>
            <li>The algorithm provides <strong>probability estimates</strong>, not certainties</li>
            <li>Forecast accuracy decreases beyond 3-4 days out</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p>Snow Day Predictor is built with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blazor WebAssembly:</strong> Modern C# web framework running entirely in your browser</li>
            <li><strong>.NET 8:</strong> Microsoft's latest application platform</li>
            <li><strong>Client-side caching:</strong> Reduces API calls and respects rate limits (5-minute cache)</li>
            <li><strong>Browser localStorage:</strong> Saves your favorite locations locally on your device</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
        <p class="disclaimer">
            Snow Day Predictor is for <strong>informational and entertainment purposes only</strong>.
            Actual school closures and delays depend on many factors including local policies, road conditions,
            administrator decisions, bus routes, and real-time weather developments. The percentages shown are
            <strong>estimates based on historical patterns and current forecasts</strong>, not official predictions.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Always check official sources</strong> for school closure announcements, including your school district's
            website, local news, and emergency notification systems.
